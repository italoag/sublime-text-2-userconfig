yUML 1.0.1 Changelog:

This is a quick bugfix release to address an issue with fairly large diagrams
failing to load.

Bug Fixes
 - Diagrams that encode to greater than yUML's GET limit of 4096 characters
   now result in a much more obvious error about why the diagram fails to
   draw.

   I will be looking to remove this limitation by POSTing to yUML in a future
   release.
